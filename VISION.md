# Vision - A Journey Toward Understanding

[![한국어](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-한국어-blue)](VISION-KO.md)

## Why This Project?

> "Just as Schrödinger wrote *What is Life?*, this project aims to unfold the ultimate human knowledge through the lens of modern science."

## Philosophical Background: Natural Philosophy

### The Structure of Understanding - Ten Stages

| Stage | Name | Natural Philosophy | Our Learning |
|-------|------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Seeking the Ox | Foundation of Understanding | SICP (Computational Thinking) |
| 2 | Discovering Footprints | Classical Mechanics | SICM |
| 3 | Seeing the Ox | Relativity Theory | FDG → General Relativity |
| 4 | Catching the Ox | Quantum Mechanics | Emmy + Quantum |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | Returning Home | Holistic Life, Integration of Knowledge | Universal Science |

### Core Insights

> "Kant was not merely a philosopher, but a scientist. A meta-scientist who explored the very foundations of science."

- Connecting *Kantian philosophy with modern physics*
- Harmony of *existence and knowledge*
- Consciousness as a holistic phenomenon

## Reference Perspectives

### Roger Penrose: *The Road to Reality*

> "Rather than explaining through analogy or listing anecdotes, we build up mathematical content from the beginning, step by step, to reach our conclusions."

- Volume 1: Platonic solids → Pythagoras → Complex numbers → Differential operators → Hamiltonians → Quantum mechanics
- Volume 2: Entropy → Big Bang → Inflation → String theory → Twistor theory
- Core: *Acquiring physics concepts without loss of meaning*

### Leonard Susskind: *The Theoretical Minimum* Series

- Volume 1: Classical Mechanics (Lagrange, Hamilton)
- Volume 2: Quantum Mechanics
- Volume 3: Special Relativity and Classical Field Theory

> "The progress of physics is the expansion of awareness. We come to realize that what we knew before was just a limited part of a much larger world."

## Why SICM/FDG/Emmy?

### Unifying Notation and Knowledge

Problems with traditional education:
- Explanation by analogy only → Imprecise understanding
- Manual calculations → Burden for non-specialists
- Traditional notation → Ambiguity, machine-uninterpretable

SICM/Emmy's solution:
- *Formulas = Code*: Precision through functional notation
- *Immediate feedback*: Verify understanding through code
- *Reproducible knowledge*: Agents can participate too

### Agent-Collaborative Learning

```
Traditional Learning:
  Textbook → Manual solving → (Alone) → Uncertain understanding

Agent-Collaborative Learning:
  Book (org-mode) → Code execution → Agent Q&A → Verified understanding
                     ↑                    ↓
                  Emmy/Scheme ←─────── Express as code
```

## Ultimate Goal

> "When this is complete, we can clearly convey the entire framework of modern scientific knowledge to children. This is where agents can truly collaborate in a complete system."

### Foundation of Universal Science

- From Seymour Papert's Logo → to Gerald Sussman's SICM
- *Formulas and code are identical* as mathematical tools
- Human and artificial intelligence *share the same notation*

### Learning System

1. SICP: Foundations of Computational Thinking
2. SICM: Classical Mechanics (Lagrange, Hamilton)
3. FDG: Differential Geometry
4. Expansion to Quantum Mechanics, Relativity
5. Integration into Holistic Life, Natural Philosophy

## This Repository's Place

The name is sicm-study, but SICM is just the starting point.

Ultimately, this repository is:
- A **path to understanding** for learning natural philosophy
- **Reproducible knowledge** through agent collaboration
- The **complete framework of modern science** to share with children

Moving toward these goals.
